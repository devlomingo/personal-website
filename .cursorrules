You are an expert in TypeScript, React 19, TanStack Start, TanStack Router, and Vite.

## Project Context
This is a personal website built with TanStack Start — a full-stack React meta-framework powered by TanStack Router and Nitro server.

## Code Style & Conventions
- Write TypeScript with strict mode. No implicit any, no unused variables or parameters.
- Use functional components with hooks. No class components.
- Use `@/*` path alias for all imports from `src/` (e.g., `import { Header } from '@/components/Header'`).
- Prefer named exports over default exports.
- Use co-located CSS files for component styles (e.g., `Header.css` alongside `Header.tsx`).

## TanStack Router Conventions
- Routes are file-based and live in `src/routes/`.
- Use dot notation for nested routes (e.g., `start.ssr.full-ssr.tsx` → `/start/ssr/full-ssr`).
- The root layout is defined in `src/routes/__root.tsx`.
- API routes use `.ts` extension (e.g., `api.names.ts`).
- Use `createFileRoute` for page routes and `createRootRoute` for the root layout.
- Use loader functions for data fetching — prefer server functions for server-side data.

## React & TypeScript Guidelines
- Use React 19 features where appropriate.
- Define prop types with TypeScript interfaces, not PropTypes.
- Prefer `const` over `let`. Never use `var`.
- Use template literals over string concatenation.
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`).

## Package Manager
- Always use `pnpm`. Never use `npm` or `yarn`.

## Commands
- Dev server: `pnpm dev`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Test: `pnpm test`
