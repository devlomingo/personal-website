My personal website. Yes, it took mass destruction of a TanStack template to get here.

## Stack

TanStack Start, React 19, TypeScript, Cloudflare Workers, and mass amounts of CSS variables.

## Run locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 and pretend you're impressed.

## Deploy

```bash
pnpm build && wrangler deploy
```

Ships to Cloudflare Workers faster than I can review a PR.
